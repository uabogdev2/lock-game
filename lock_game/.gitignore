pubspec.lock # Typically version controlled, but can cause issues with automated tools if many files change
# If pubspec.lock is frequently causing "too many files changed" errors with tools,
# and your team agrees, you might consider ignoring it for the tool's run,
# but it's generally recommended to track it.
# For this tool, if it continues to be an issue, we might need to temporarily ignore it.
# For now, let's keep it tracked as is standard.
